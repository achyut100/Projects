## BookFlow

Bookflow is an image-processing based image search engine which was inspired by google images much like google images when searched with an image shows the relevant results we decided to build a similar platform for books.
Upon passing an queried book image BookFlow, extracts features from the passed image and tries to locate the book image as stored in the database upon a match it shows the details of the book stored in the database and the percentage of the match.
